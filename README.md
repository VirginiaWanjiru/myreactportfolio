# ReactPortfolio
This repository contains my portfolio implemented  in React. Faced some challenges hence I had to redo the project. Here is a link to the previous repository: https://github.com/VirginiaWanjiru/ReactPortfolio

Here is the link to the current portfolio in react hosted on github pages: https://virginiawanjiru.github.io/myreactportfolio/

Here is the link to the portfolio done in HTML,CSS and JS : https://virginiawanjiru.github.io/PersonalPortfolio-DigitalExplorers/


Q and A section 

Questions
What is NPM?
Npm stands for node package manager which developers use to install dependencies, manage versions, run scripts in a package.json file, and share code. It simplifies package management and helps streamline the development process.

What is SPA?
SPA is a type of web application that dynamically updates content on a single web page rather than loading separate pages from the server. SPAs use JavaScript to interact with the server and update the page without requiring full page reloads, resulting in faster and more responsive user experiences guaranteeing immediate response to change.


What is the event loop?
Refers to the mechanism through which JavaScript manages asynchronous tasks and updates the user interface. React's event loop coordinates the scheduling and execution of various operations, including rendering updates, handling user interactions, and managing component lifecycles. It ensures that applications remain responsive by efficiently processing tasks and reconciling changes to the virtual DOM with minimal performance overhead.

What is the difference between export x and export default x? How do you import them differently?
They are used to export values from a module. Export x is used to export named exports from a module. You can export multiple values using this syntax, and when importing them, you need to use curly braces {} and specify the names of the exports you want to import. Export default x  is used to export a default export from a module. You can only have one default export per module. When importing a default export, you can choose any name you want for the imported value.

Why do you use className as a property in React and not class?
class is a reserved name in react for defining purposes.

Why should you not write the following? What will happen?

<button onClick={setCounter(counter + 1)}> +1 </button>  -->setCounter(counter + 1) will be executed first and not when the button is clicked because it is within the OnClick attribute and that's now how the code is intended to work.


What is object deconstruction and how is it connected to React components (example)? 

Object deconstruction allows extracting multiple properties from an object and assigning them to variables. For instance, in a functional component, you can deconstruct props directly in the function parameters:

const Component1 = ({ name, age }) => {
  return <div>{name} is {age} years old</div>;
};

How is it possible to use HTML and JavaScript in the same function (like in a React Component)? What makes it possible under the hood?

It allows developers to write HTML-like code directly within JavaScript functions.

eg const element = <h2>Hello, I am Virginia!</h2>; JSX code is not directly understood by browsers. Therefore, it needs to be converted into plain JavaScript through Babel, a popular JavaScript compiler, that transforms JSX into function calls.

What is async/await? Bring an example

It allows one to write asynchronous code that looks and behaves like synchronous code, making it easier to read and understand.
eg:


function resolveAfter2Seconds() {
  return new Promise(resolve => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      resolve('resolved');
    }, 2000);
  });
}


async function asyncCall() {
  console.log('Calling...');
  const result = await resolveAfter2Seconds(); // Pauses execution until promise is resolved
  console.log(result); // Logs 'resolved' after 2 seconds
}

asyncCall();



What is a Promise? Bring an example

A promise is like a placeholder for the result of an operation whether successful or not.

eg.

let NewPromise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  
  setTimeout(() => {
    let data = 'This is the data fetched from the server';  
  }, 2000);
});


NewPromise.then((data) => {
console.log('Promise resolved:', data);})
.catch((error) => {
console.log('Promise rejected:', error);
});
